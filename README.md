# matplotlab-examples
Minimum example codes for matplotlib draw deep learning diagrams, easy to understand and re-use

### Example lists

#### 2d curves
Plot three curves in different colours with legend.

#### 2d divede
Plot two clusters of 2d points with transparency, and draw a division line between them.

#### 3d clusters
Scatter data points onto a 3d Axis.

#### 3d divide
3d division surface between two clusters of points.

#### 2d-gaussian
Plot 2d-gaussian in 2D axis and 3D axis.

#### activation-curves
Draw four common activation functions used in deep learning.

#### loss-trend
Show the loss trending of deep learning training and draw regression line on it.

#### multi-branch-accuracy
Draw multi-task deep learning accuracy, together with a regression line to show the trendency.

#### multi-branch-loss
Draw multi-task deep learning losses, together with a regression line to show the trendency.
